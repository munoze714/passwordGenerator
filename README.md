# passwordGenerator
This application is a Password Generator that prompts you for certain criteria. The more complex your password the more secure it will be. I was super challenge on this one with the different blocks of function and variables. But i think it made me more fimiliar with using functions. I like clean and orginize so i really tried to make it less of a web lol. In the end i think it was a fun project.
